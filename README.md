# 🐍 Snake Inside-Out

A flipped take on the classic Snake game — where shrinking is survival.  
Built for the **Remix Jam** under the theme: _Flip the Script_.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Move your snake across a grid using **arrow keys** or **WASD**  
- Eat regular food to **shrink**  
- Eat special blocks to **grow**  
- Game over when your snake disappears completely  
- Balance is key: shrink too much and you vanish, grow too much and... well, you'll see 👀

---

## 🧠 Twist

Instead of growing endlessly, you must **manage your size**.  
The tension flips: shrinking is dangerous, but growing too much can also be risky.  
It’s a game of restraint, rhythm, and reversal.

## 🔁 Remix Hooks

Want to remix this? Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🍇 **Toxic fruit** that causes instant game over  
- 🐍 **Multiplayer snakes** competing for space or trying to eat each other  
- ⚡ **Power-ups** that reverse controls, freeze time, or spawn walls  
- 🎲 **Random events** like moving obstacles or gravity shifts  
- 🧬 **DNA mode**: snake mutates with each bite (speed, color, behavior)
